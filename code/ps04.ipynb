The result is a different looking waveform, because \"rotating\" each component by the same phase offset does not shift each component by the same amount of time.\n",

These operations are relatively fast, taking time proportional to N2, where N is the length of the wave array. That would be fast enough for many applications, but it turns out that there is a faster algorithm, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which takes time proportional to N logN.\n",
